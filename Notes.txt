Defining base quality colours:

Turns out ncurses only uses the colours defined in curses.h
for compatibility reasons, but those colours can be tweaked

To represent the different qualities of the base calls
it is probably best to define ranges for the colours, until
i look more into defining colour ranges in the future.

Always need to add a gaurd statement for ncurses colours 
as well of if(has_colors() == FALSE) the exit and endwin()
as the terminal can display the colours.

As mvprintw print the buffer, it actually just expands
multiple addch commands. So it probably better to use the 
addch commands and then add a colour pair to each one.
