Defining base quality colours:

Turns out ncurses only uses the colours defined in curses.h
for compatibility reasons, but those colours can be tweaked

To represent the different qualities of the base calls
it is probably best to define ranges for the colours, until
i look more into defining colour ranges in the future.

Always need to add a gaurd statement for ncurses colours 
as well of if(has_colors() == FALSE) the exit and endwin()
as the terminal can display the colours.

As mvprintw print the buffer, it actually just expands
multiple addch commands. So it probably better to use the 
addch commands and then add a colour pair to each one.


No time to work today:( but it for sending data to the terminal 
for display, probably best to create an array of structs containing 
the nessecary colour pair and qc value (or index of the needed colour pair)

Feeding this through a function as an array will likely be friendlier than
before


More information about fastq data can be found here: https://www.drive5.com/usearch/manual/quality_score.html


FastQ files contain coordinates in their names as well, so they can be graphed to determine cluster belonging!

ASCII chars range from 33 to 106 or ('!' to K) for new illumina

and for old illumina '@' to 'j'

both offset between 0 to 42 (corresponds to the q score)

To calculate probability formula is P = 10^-Q/10

and 

Q is -10log(P)


need to create a jump table for the coloured pairs or many
defines
