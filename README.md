# FastqcMatrix
## Why

## Build Instructions
Currently the build process is not well programmed. But it will be oneday! The gzip library, ncurses and klib are required to compile the binary, with the current target being built by typing in "make bin/test_kseq" using gcc.

## TODO
- [ ] Adapt to changing window sizes
- [ ] Fix scrolling to be more like c_matrix as it really hurts the eyes currently
